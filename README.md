# Bridge
Android app final project for Google J-term 

## What is Bridge?
Was there a time when you asked your friends to get you bubble tea on their way back to campus? 

Wouldn't it be nice if you can ask not only your friends, but anyone on campus to get you something on their way back to campus?

BRIDGE provides the platform for you to connect with people on campus!

For example,
* “Getters” upload "trips" that they are going to LimeRed Bubble tea house and will be back by 5:00PM today 
* “Setters” can request orders such as one Matcha Bubble Tea to the getter
* The getter can confirm the request and then setters can send the money via venmo 
* The getter picks up the drinks and give them to the setters when they get back
